#Minicraft for Android

The original game, made by Notch (http://notch.tumblr.com/) can be found here https://s3.amazonaws.com/ld48/ld22/index.html
This is my attempt at porting it to Android.

**This fork uses the Zeemote bluetooth controller instead of on-screen controls**

##To do

- Save & Resume game
- Optimisation so that game run smoother with less memory footprint 
- Testing: not sure if game works at lower levels yet.
